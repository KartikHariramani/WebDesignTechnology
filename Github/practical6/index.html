    <h1>Welcome to my Blog!!!</h1>
    <div id="kamal4">As an educator, professional and personal growth often happen simultaneously. I am sure there are many of you out there who have lived the shock of finally having written and organized all lesson plans and class materials after years of developing plans on the fly, become comfortable with your subject matter and craft and, BAM, you are now teaching a different subject. Or, for some, a different grade level. I was a social studies teacher and later abruptly moved to English to help impact test scores in hopes of raising the school performance rating. Professionally, I was on the move again, with a learning curve and an entirely new plan to create, with a subject to re-familiarize myself with. I knew I was being forced to stretch, to grow, and to learn, which is something I ask my students to do daily. New challenges keep me humble and acutely aware of the learning process. </div>
